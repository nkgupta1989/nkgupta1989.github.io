I love building amazing products.

I am passionate about building readily deployable, automated tested, high rpm softwares using mongodb, MySQL, redis, cassandra, as data stores, and nodejs, PHP, python as developing languages. 

Other than this I have hands on knowledge about ansible scripts, AWS, nginx, newrelic, code igniter, loopback (Strongloop), Rest apiâ€™s, integration with mobile apps.

I enjoy working on application designing for large distributed platforms, and also like wearing a devops hat sometimes to ensure continuous delivery at dedicated time.
